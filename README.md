# RayTracer

This project was to build a RayTracer in C++ from the ground up using only the GLM library (openGL Math, https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html). This RayTracer includes perspective and orthographic viewing, ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, multiple different 3D shapes (spheres, polygons, ellipses, cylinders), reflections, and shadows.

Some starter code was given, but most (lighting calculations, ray calculations, quadric shape calculations, reflections, shadows) was written by me.

To run, you must have Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later. Open the .sln file with visual studio and click run (you will get better performance running in release mode instead of debug mode).
